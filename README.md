## Project Title: New York City Airbnb Open Data via Kaggle
### Techniques employed:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Scikit-learn
- Pipeline building
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
### Summary: <br/>
 Airbnb’s within one area are priced differently for various reasons. In this assignment, I first
used exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib to explore numerical data variables. Next, I employed
scikit-learn to split data into training and test sets. After this, I then built a pipeline to produce usable
training and testing data. Lastly, I performed linear regression and decision tree regression root mean
square errors to see which model best predicted Airbnb pricing based on the available variables.

## Project Title: Income Classification
### Techniques employed:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Logistic regression
- Support vector machine model
- Poly support vector machine model
- Naïve bayes model
- K-nearest neighbor
- Hyperparameter tuning
### Summary: <br/>
  Income determination of individuals has been an interest in the context of addressing social
problems, such as poverty. In this assignment, classification techniques were tested to determine which
model was best able to determine if an individual made over $50,000 USD per year. Exploratory data
analysis was performed using Seaborn. Test and training data were separated using scikit-learn. Next,
logistic regression, SVM, pSVM, naïve bayes, and KNN models were tested. It was determined that SVM
was the best model to use in order to classify which individuals made over $50K.

## Project Title: Unsupervised machine learning techniques for vehicle pricing
### Techniques employed:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree regression
- Random forest regression
### Summary: <br/>
  Vehicles of all brands and conditions vary in price across the world. In this project, regression
techniques were employed to determine which model best predicted vehicle price. Exploratory data
analysis was performed using Seaborn. Test and training data were separated using scikit-learn. Next,
linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression were tested.
In this exercise, random forest regression was found to be the best predictor of vehicle pricing.

## Project Title: Predicting heart disease
### Techniques employed:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Logistic regression
- Support vector machine model
- Naïve bayes model
### Summary: <br/>
  Across the United States, heart disease is a top killer of American adults. When people are
admitted to the hospital, numerous data points are collected. In this assignment, we used common health
data points in order to find which model most accurately predicted whether someone would develop heart
disease. Models chosen for comparison included logistic regression, SVM, and naïve bayes modeling. It
was found that logistic regression was the best model to use to predict whether someone is likely to
develop heart disease
